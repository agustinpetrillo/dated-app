Hello everyone! This is probably the most complex web app I'm working as a side project. I hope y'll like it because it's a Full-Stack application.

## If you didn't read the description of the project, the backend host shuts down when nobody is using it, so if you wanna use the web app, you'll need to wait a bit!

Also if you wanna take a look of my backend project, it's in my repositories! I'm using NestJS with MongoDB and Moongose
